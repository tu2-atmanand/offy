## TODO :
1. Optimizing the AI model
2. Optimizing the Speech Recognition model
3. Making GUI
4. For now upload purpose this will be in python, you can create an android app also but than ill see how to make it wih C++.


### To be asked on stackoverflow
I tried to create an ML model just to have a friendly conversation here.
Now this types of model created through the coding i did, are basically like a database which finds the best match and returns the result which are not at all generated by the AI, just the previous human responses.
If i want to create a model like Lambda, also assuming the model size will be less and trained on less data. What is the difference between the model I created in my project, is it the huge dataset or the programming which made lambda to generate its own answers after training on this huge dataset.

I just want some resources or example of how the code will be to build a model close to lambda, that is the essential feature i need is to generate answers on its own. Obviously this will be on not huge data set like that for lambda.

Please also share if there is a dataset for creating this model.


## My Points

1. i have made the code in VoskDemo the file which detects my voice really worse so now i dont know if it is working bad or what, or only im feeling it. see the original project code to make it optimized again
